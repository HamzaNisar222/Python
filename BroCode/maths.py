# Here we be learning regarding math module and its use full functions to perform various operation related mathmetics 
import math

pi= 3.14 #lets take a variable
x=1
y=2
z=3
print(round(pi))#rounds the number off and return 3
print(math.ceil(pi))#rounds a number off to upper limit
print(math.floor(pi))#rounds anumber off to lower limit
print(math.sqrt(pi))#for squareroot of a number 
print(abs(pi))#returns absolute value
print(pow(pi,4))#return power of the number 1st arg is base and 2nd is power or exponent
print(max(x,y,z))#returns max number 
print(min(x,y,z))#return minimum among the vars
