# # Like many other popular programming languages, strings in 
# Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

# However, Python does not have a character data type, a single 
# character is simply a string with a length of 1.

# # Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a[5])

# # Looping through strings 
# for x in "banana":
#   print(x)

# # print length of a string
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(len(a))

# # Check for a word in string 
# txt = "The best things in life are free!"
# print("free" in txt)

# # Check for a word in string with if 
# txt = "The best things in life are!"
# if "free" in txt:
#  print("Yes, 'free' is present.")
# else:
#   print("not present")


# # Check if word not present in string 
# txt = "The best things in life are free!"
# print("free" not in txt)


# # with if statement if not present 
# txt = "The best things in life are free!"
# if "free" not in txt:
#  print("Yes, 'free' is not present.")
# else:
#   print(" free is present")
